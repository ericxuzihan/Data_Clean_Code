# Data_Clean_Code & Web Automation
I created these Python scripts for Bordan Shoe Co. to help cleaning data and web automation.
The scripts including the following feature and can be used as source code(also for my perosnal reference):

1. use "xlrd" Python library to open a excel workbook
2. extract data from a excel workbook
3. edit those data through list and dictionary(hash map)
4. use "xlwt" to open a new excel workbook, write into it and save.
5. Created different algorithm to address massisve data, and tailor the excel format to meet requirements. 
6. A templete designed for web print automation through .py script, which it can login to the target webpage, clicking button as human        does and printing the daily report.
7. A Python script designed for extract UPC code from Excel, check one by one in the Oracle NetSuite ERP management system and extract        detail information, then saving as a new output file.
