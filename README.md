# Data_Clean_Code
I created these Python scripts for Bordan Shoe Co. to help cleaning data.
The scripts including the following feature and can be used as source code(also can be my perosnal reference):

1. use "xlrd" Python library to open a excel workbook
2. extract data from a excel workbook
3. edit those data through list and dictionary(hash map)
4. use "xlwt" to open a new excel workbook, write into it and save.
5. Created different algorithm to address massisve data, and tailor the excel format to meet requirements. 
6. A templete designed for web print automation through .py script, which it can login to the target webpage, clicking button as human    does and printing the daily report.
